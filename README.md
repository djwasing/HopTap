# WhiskeyUnited
 
 This is an app used to keep track of different whiskeys the user wishes to sample, and the ones they have already sampled. The user starts by typing the name of the whiskey in the input field, then selecting if it's a whiskey they've already tried or not, then clicking 'submit'. 

Based on their input the whiskey they entered goes into an area of the page displaying whiskey they have yet to sample or whiskey they have already sampled. 

This project presented many challenges. Gaining a better understanding of the MVC framework was a certainly a hill to climb. Utilizing handlebars for this assignment was also a challenge because it separates elements that so far have all been on the same file. 

The last major hurdle with this assignment was getting the app to deploy properly on heroku. This was the first time I've deployed an app with a database, so that was a new experience. I will admit I had to delete 2 apps before I got it right, but if at first you don't succeed, try again (and again in my case). 

I did some work on the UI/CSS of this app, but it's not totally polished. There was enough work to do on the logic side of things. 

This is a fun app that I could see myself using. I would like to jump back in and polish the UI and make it mobile friendly, so I could edit my lists via my phone while at a new distillery. 

Thanks for visiting. Cheers!
